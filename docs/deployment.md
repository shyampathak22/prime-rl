# Deployment

You can deploy PRIME-RL on a single GPU and larger multi-node clusters.

## SFT

### Single-GPU

For training on a single GPU, no communication orchestration is required and you can choose whether to start your trainer using our trainer entrypoint or using `torchrun`.

To start with our `sft` entrypoint

```bash
uv run sft ...
```

To do the same thing, but using `torchrun`

```bash
uv run torchrun src/prime_rl/trainer/sft/train.py ...
```

### Multi-GPU

For training on multiple GPUs, use `torchrun` with the `--nproc-per-node` flag.

```bash
uv run torchrun \
  --local-rank-filter 0 \
  --nproc-per-node 8 \
  src/prime_rl/trainer/sft/train.py ...
```

*The `--local-rank-filter` flag is used to only log the logs from the master rank, as detailed in [logging](logging.md).*

### Multi-Node

For training on multiple nodes, use `torchrun` with the `--nnodes`, `--node-rank`, and `--rdzv-endpoint` flags.

First, decide which node will be your head node and find a reachable private IP address for it. If your nodes are not colocated, you will likely need to setup VPN (e.g. [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com)) for the nodes to reach each other. 

(*Skip this step if the default network interface is sufficient.*) Make sure to set the network interface for GLOO and NCCL to one that allows all nodes to reach each other.

```bash
# On both nodes
export GLOO_SOCKET_IFNAME=...
export NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=...
```
 
Then, configure the rendezvous endpoint to allow the nodes to find each other. Here, `MASTER_ADDR` is the private IP address of the head node and `MASTER_PORT` is a free port on the head node, typically port 29500 for `torchrun`.

```bash
# On both nodes
export MASTER_ADDR=...
export MASTER_PORT=...
```

Then, on the head node, run

```bash
# On node 0
uv run torchrun \
  --nnodes 2 \
  --node-rank 0 \
  --rdzv-endpoint=$MASTER_ADDR:$MASTER_PORT \
  --local-rank-filter 0 \
  --nproc-per-node 8 \
  src/prime_rl/trainer/sft/train.py ...
```

And on the second node, run

```bash
# On node 1
uv run torchrun \
  --nnodes 2 \
  --node-rank 1 \
  --rdzv-endpoint=$MASTER_ADDR:$MASTER_PORT \
  --local-rank-filter 0 \
  --nproc-per-node 8 \
  src/prime_rl/trainer/sft/train.py ...
```

### SLURM

TBD.

## Inference

We rely on vLLMs multi-node deployment primitives and load balancing for multi-node deployments. Currently, vLLM supports multi-node data parallel deployment ([docs](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/v0.10.0/serving/data_parallel_deployment.html)).

First, decide which node will be your head node and find a reachable private IP address for it. If your nodes are not colocated, you will likely need to setup VPN (e.g. [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com)) for the nodes to reach each other. 

(*Skip this step if the default network interface is sufficient.*) Make sure to set the network interface for GLOO and NCCL to one that allows all nodes to reach each other.

```bash
# On both nodes
export GLOO_SOCKET_IFNAME=...
export NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=...
```
 
Then, configure the data parallel address as the private IP address of the head node.

```bash
# On both nodes
export DATA_PARALLEL_ADDRESS=...
export DATA_PARALLEL_RPC_PORT=...
```

To run TP=4 and DP=4 with DP ranks 0 and 1 on the head node and DP ranks 2 and 3 on the second node, run

```bash
# On node 0
uv run inference \
	--data-parallel-size 4 \
	--tensor-parallel-size 4 \
	--data-parallel-size-local 2 \
	--data-parallel-address $DATA_PARALLEL_ADDRESS \
	--data-parallel-rpc-port $DATA_PARALLEL_RPC_PORT
```

```bash
# On node 1
uv run inference \
	--data-parallel-size 4 \
	--tensor-parallel-size 4 \
	--data-parallel-size-local 2 \
	--data-parallel-address $DATA_PARALLEL_ADDRESS \
	--data-parallel-rpc-port $DATA_PARALLEL_RPC_PORT \
	--data-parallel-start-rank 2 \
	--headless
```

## RL

### Single-GPU Training

If you only have access to a single GPU, you may still be able to run small RL experiments. To do so, configure your inference server to use only a fraction of the available memory to leave some space for the trainer.

For example, to run an RL training on a single GPU while using 50% of the available memory for the inference server, run

```bash
bash scripts/tmux.sh
```

```bash
uv run rl \
  --trainer @ path/to/train.toml \
  --orchestrator @ path/to/orch.toml \
  --inference @ path/to/infer.toml \
  --trainer-gpu-ids 0 \
  --inference-gpu-ids 0 \
  --inference.gpu-memory-utilization 0.5
```

*Make sure to tune the `--gpu-memory-utilization` value such that you have enough GPU memory for the RL trainer.* 

You can also set this up by starting each submodule manually.

```bash
# Run this in the `Inference` pane
uv run inference @ path/to/infer.toml --gpu-memory-utilization 0.5
```

```bash
# Run this in the `Orchestrator` pane
uv run orchestrator @ path/to/orch.toml
```

```bash
# Run this in the `Trainer` pane
uv run trainer @ path/to/train.toml
```

### Multi-GPU Training

For single-node training, we recommend using the `rl` entrypoint to conveniently start all components, i.e. the inference server, the orchestrator, and the trainer. 

By default, the inference server starts on GPU ID 0 and the trainer on GPU ID 1.

```bash
uv run rl \
  --trainer @ path/to/train.toml \
  --orchestrator @ path/to/orch.toml \
  --inference @ path/to/infer.toml \
```

You can configure to GPU IDs to use for the inference server and the trainer. For example, to run the inference server on GPUs IDs 0-5 with data parallelism and the trainer on GPUs IDs 6-7

```bash
uv run rl \
  --trainer @ path/to/train.toml \
  --orchestrator @ path/to/orch.toml \
  --inference @ path/to/infer.toml \
  --inference-gpu-ids 0,1,2,3,4,5 \
  --trainer-gpu-ids 6,7 \
  --inference.parallel.dp 6
```

### Parallel Experiments

For quick ablations, it can be more efficient to parallelize experiments within a node (e.g. split your GPUs to run two experiments in parallel). For example, if you have access to 4 GPUs and your experiment fits on 2 GPUs, you can parallelize two experiments as follows:

Start the first experiment in a tmux session `exp1` with outputs directory `outputs1`. Specify it both in the tmux script, as well as in the start command (*will use the first 2 GPUs*)

```bash
bash scripts/tmux.sh -s exp1 -o outputs1
```

```bash
# Run this in the `Trainer` pane
uv run rl \
  --trainer @ path/to/train.toml \
  --orchestrator @ path/to/orch.toml \
  --inference @ path/to/infer.toml \
  --output-dir outputs1
```

For the second experiment, start a second tmux session named `exp2` with outputs directory `outputs2`. In addition, specify a new server port for the inference engine and orchestrator (*will use the last 2 GPUs*)

```bash
bash scripts/tmux.sh -s exp-2 -o outputs2
```

```bash
# Run this in the `Trainer` pane
uv run rl \
  --trainer @ path/to/train.toml \
  --orchestrator @ path/to/orch.toml \
  --inference @ path/to/infer.toml \
  --inference-gpu-ids 2 \
  --trainer-gpu-ids 3 \
  --inference.server.port 8001 \
  --orchestrator.client.base-url http://localhost:8001/v1 \
  --output-dir outputs2
```

### Multi-Node Training

> We currently require shared file system for multi-node RL training.

To faciliate multi-node RL training, ensure that all nodes have access to a shared file system and that the node that will run the inference server is reachable from the orchestrator via a private or public IP address. Then, set the following environment variables on all nodes:

```bash
# On all nodes
export OUTPUT_DIR=...               # Path to directory in shared file system
export INFERENCE_SERVER_IP=...      # Reachable IP address of the inference node
export INFERENCE_SERVER_API_KEY=... # API key for the inference server
```

Then, start the inference server on one node.

```bash
# On one node
uv run inference ... \
    --api-key $INFERENCE_SERVER_API_KEY --parallel ...
```

Then, start a single orchestrator

```bash
# On either node
uv run orchestrator ... \
    --client.base-url http://$INFERENCE_SERVER_IP:8000/v1 \
    --client.api-key-var INFERENCE_SERVER_API_KEY \
    --output-dir $OUTPUT_DIR
```

Finally, start the trainer on one as described in the [Trainer](#trainer) section.

```bash
# On other node
uv run torchrun \
    --nproc-per-node 8 \
    --local-rank-filter 0 \
    src/prime_rl/trainer/rl/train.py ... \
    --output-dir $OUTPUT_DIR
```

Of course, you can further scale up the number of nodes used by the trainer and inference server, as described in the sections above. However, make sure that there is only a single orchestrator instance.

### SLURM

TBD.

## Kubernetes

For deployments on Kubernetes clusters, PRIME-RL provides a Helm chart that manages the entire training infrastructure including orchestrator, trainer, and inference components with automatic pod scheduling, GPU allocation, and shared storage.
